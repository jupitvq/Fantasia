# ðŸŒ¸ Fantasia

A visual novel about a male student, who just moving in from his old school to new school. But everything should be fine for him right?

This project meant to be Final Project for first and second semester, to program and design a game using Python language, and we decided to use [Ren'py](https://www.renpy.org/) as our game engine. And it turned out only the first chapter we could make. By that, we stated that **this project is currently discontinued**. And who knows, one day it might be continued again!

Feel free to use this project as inspiration or your needs, __but **DO NOT** claim this project as yours or using it for unintended/malicious purposes!__
